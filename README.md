# Email-Checker-tool
A Golang program that goes through DNS records using a domain entered by the user; It considers MX, SPF, and DMARC records to verify email configurations and test the security settings.

Features of my Project: 
Validates MX records for email server availability
Verifies SPF records to prevent email spoofing
Examines DMARC policies for enhanced email security
 
 I did not have to use any other technology except Golang and was able to achieve my goal using the standard packages.
